Chess GUI in java

Setup:

- if you want to use a uci engine, there should be a config.txt file in the working directory of the program containing the line ( the 'dist' folder in the repository )

engine=[engine path]

- if you dont want to use an engine clear this line from config.txt because a wrong path causes the program to crash

Usage:

to start the program,

in the 'dist' folder:

- click on javachessgui.jar

or

- type: java -jar javachessgui.jar
